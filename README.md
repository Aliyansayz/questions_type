List of questions for science subjects. Which can be asked to the AI to redesign topic. 


## Category 1: Direct Input & Selection

These are the most straightforward types, but often with an interactive twist.

Numeric Input: The most common type. You are asked to calculate a value and type the number into a box.

Purpose: Tests direct calculation and problem-solving.

Example: "A square has a perimeter of 28. What is its area?" You type 49.

Text Input: You are asked to type a specific word or short phrase.

Purpose: Tests understanding of terminology and key concepts.

Example: "This type of logical argument, which starts with a general rule and applies it to a specific case, is called ____." You type Deduction.

Visual Multiple Choice (Image Selection): Instead of text options, you are presented with several diagrams, graphs, or images and must click on the correct one.

Purpose: Tests visual and spatial reasoning. It's much harder to guess than text-based multiple choice.

Example: "Which of the following graphs represents the function y = -x² + 3?" (Shows four different parabolas).

Multiple Select (Checkboxes): You are asked to select all options that apply from a list.

Purpose: Tests comprehensive knowledge of a concept's properties, forcing you to evaluate each option independently.

Example: "Select all of the following that are properties of an equilateral triangle." (Options: "All sides are equal," "All angles are 60°," "Has one right angle," "Has two equal sides").

## Category 2: Interactive & Manipulative

This is the core of Brilliant’s "active learning" philosophy. You learn by doing and seeing the immediate consequences of your actions.

Interactive Graph Sliders: As you mentioned, this is a hallmark of Brilliant. You drag a slider that controls a variable (e.g., the slope m in y = mx + b) and see the graph update in real-time.

Purpose: To build deep, intuitive understanding of how parameters affect functions and systems.

Example: A slider controls the value of c in a quadratic y = ax² + bx + c. The question asks: "What does the parameter c represent?" By moving the slider, you discover it's the y-intercept.

Object Manipulation & Simulation: You can drag, drop, rotate, or connect objects within a virtual canvas to solve a puzzle.

Purpose: To make abstract rules concrete and engaging. Excellent for geometry, logic, and physics-based math problems.

Example (Geometry): "Arrange the four shapes to form a perfect square."

Example (Logic): "Drag the weights onto the scales to determine which one is the heaviest in the fewest weighings."

Click-to-Highlight / Annotation: You interact directly with a diagram by clicking on specific parts of it.

Purpose: Tests your ability to identify specific components or features within a complex system.

Example (Calculus): "Click on all the local maxima in the function shown."

Example (Geometry): "Click on the hypotenuse of the right triangle."

Pathfinding or Connection: You are asked to draw a line or connect dots to find a solution.

Purpose: Ideal for graph theory, logic puzzles, and optimization problems.

Example: "Find the shortest path from node A to node F in the weighted graph below."

## Category 3: Conceptual & Logical

These questions test the "why" behind the math, not just the "what."

"Which of these is/are true?": A more advanced form of multiple select that often presents subtle conceptual statements, some of which may be common misconceptions.

Purpose: To test the precision of your understanding.

Example: After a lesson on number theory, a question might be: "Given an integer n > 2, which of the following statements are always true?"

Counter-example Selection: Instead of proving something true, you are asked to find the one case that proves a statement false.

Purpose: A powerful way to test the boundaries and conditions of a mathematical rule.

Example: "The statement 'All prime numbers are odd' is false. Select the number below that serves as a counter-example." (Options include 2, 7, 11, 13).

"Build the Equation/Expression": You are given tiles representing numbers, variables, and operators, and you must drag them into a box to construct a valid expression or equation.

Purpose: Reinforces syntax and the structure of mathematical statements.

Example: "Using the tiles, construct the quadratic formula."

## Category 4: Structural & Sequential

These questions are about process and order.

Drag-and-Drop Ordering: You are given a series of steps (for a proof, an algorithm, or solving an equation) and must drag them into the correct logical sequence.

Purpose: Teaches logical reasoning and the structure of a formal argument or procedure.

Example: "Arrange the following lines in the correct order to complete the proof that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°."

In summary, Brilliant's questioning method is a deliberate pedagogical choice to move beyond simple right/wrong answers. The goal of the interactivity is to ensure you:

Build Intuition: By "playing" with a concept via sliders and simulations.

Learn Actively: By forcing you to construct, manipulate, and experiment rather than just consuming information.

Avoid Guesswork: It's much harder to guess the right way to manipulate a simulation than to guess a multiple-choice answer.

Make Connections: By seeing visually how different mathematical ideas (e.g., an algebraic formula and its geometric graph) are linked.
